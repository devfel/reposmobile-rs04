  RS Challenge 4: React Native Concepts
</h3>

## :rocket: About the Challenge


In this challenge, I created an application to practice React Native.

I continued to develop the application that will store my portfolio repositories, which I already developed the backend using Node.js and the Web Front with ReactJS.

This time the following functionalities were added:
 - List my API's repositories: Able to create a list of all repositories that are registered in my API with the title, techs and number of likes.
 - Like a listed API repository: Able to like an item in your API through a button with the text Like and update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile.
